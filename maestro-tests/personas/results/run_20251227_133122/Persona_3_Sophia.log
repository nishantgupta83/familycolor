Element not found: Text matching regex: Ocean

Element with Text matching regex: Ocean not found. Check the UI hierarchy in debug artifacts to verify if the element exists.

Possible causes:
- Element selector may be incorrect - check if there are similar elements with slightly different names/properties.
- Element may be temporarily unavailable due to loading state.
- This could be a real regression that needs to be addressed.
