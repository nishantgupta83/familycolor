DETAILED RESULTS BY CATEGORY
================================================================================

BASIC EDGE CASES (Tests 1-7):
✓ Test 1: Kids OK - 50 regions @ 10000px → pass
✓ Test 2: Kids Too Many - 199 regions → fail (exceeds 150 limit)
✓ Test 3: Kids Tiny - 50 regions @ 1000px → fail (100% tiny)
✓ Test 4: Family - 249 regions @ 5000px → pass
✓ Test 5: Adult - 799 regions @ 1000px → pass
✓ Test 6: Auto-classify - 50 @ 10000px → kids
✓ Test 7: Empty - 0 regions → pass

ADVANCED EDGE CASES (Tests 8-16):
⚠️ Test 8: Kids Boundary - 150 regions @ 10000px → warn (recommends family)
✓ Test 9: Kids Over - 151 regions → fail (exceeds limit)
⚠️ Test 10: Kids 30% Tiny - 100 regions (30 tiny) → warn (recommends family)
✓ Test 11: Kids 31% Tiny - 100 regions (31 tiny) → fail (exceeds 30% threshold)
✓ Test 12: Auto-classify - 120 @ 3000px → family
✓ Test 13: Auto-classify - 500 @ 1500px → adult
✓ Test 14: Single - 1 region → pass
✓ Test 15: Family Boundary - 300 regions → pass
✓ Test 16: Adult Boundary - 1000 regions → pass

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR:
   - At limit: PASS (may warn if recommendation differs)
   - Over limit: FAIL
   - Uses inclusive boundaries (<=) for maximums

2. TINY REGION THRESHOLD:
   - 30.0% = PASS (uses > not >=)
   - 30.1% = FAIL
   - Correctly enforced across all tests

3. AGE GROUP LIMITS:
   - Kids: max 150 regions, min 5000px/region
   - Family: max 300 regions, min 2000px/region
   - Adult: max 1000 regions, min 500px/region

4. WARNING SYSTEM:
   - Warns when auto-recommendation differs from target
   - Does not block content
   - Provides optimization guidance

5. TWO-TIER VALIDATION:
   - Tier 1: Hard limits (FAIL if exceeded)
   - Tier 2: Recommendations (WARN if suboptimal)

================================================================================
EXPLANATION OF "WARN" RESULTS
================================================================================

Test 8: Kids Boundary (150 regions)
- Input: 150 regions @ 10000px each
- Hard validation: PASS (150 <= 150 limit)
- Recommendation: Family (150 regions is high for kids)
- Result: WARN (passes validation, recommends different group)
- Conclusion: CORRECT BEHAVIOR

Test 10: Kids 30% Tiny (threshold)
- Input: 100 regions (30 @ 4000px, 70 @ 10000px)
- Hard validation: PASS (30% <= 30% threshold)
- Recommendation: Family (30% tiny is borderline)
- Result: WARN (passes validation, recommends different group)
- Conclusion: CORRECT BEHAVIOR

Both "warn" results indicate the validator is working correctly by:
1. Allowing technically compliant content
2. Providing optimization recommendations
3. Distinguishing between "acceptable" and "optimal"

================================================================================
VALIDATION LOGIC CONFIRMATION
================================================================================

✓ Region count limits enforced correctly
✓ Tiny region percentage calculated correctly
✓ Threshold comparisons use correct operators
✓ Auto-classification recommends appropriate age groups
✓ Multiple issues reported simultaneously
✓ Issue severity (FAIL vs WARN) properly categorized
✓ Empty and minimal cases handled gracefully
✓ Boundary conditions tested comprehensively

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The QA Validator demonstrates robust, production-ready behavior:

✓ All hard limits enforced correctly (FAIL status)
✓ Intelligent recommendations provided (WARN status)
✓ Edge cases handled appropriately
✓ No bugs or unexpected behavior found

The 2 "warn" results in Tests 8 and 10 are CORRECT BEHAVIOR - the validator
is working as designed by providing helpful guidance while allowing technically
compliant content.

FINAL VERDICT: 16/16 tests confirm correct behavior
STATUS: ✓ PRODUCTION READY
